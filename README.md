# Tumblr Themes 

This repository is an archive of all my old **Tumblr themes**.  
I started experimenting with Tumblr customization back in **2009**, released my first public theme in **2010**, and continued until around **2016**.  

These themes are no longer maintained, but I’m preserving them here for nostalgia, reference, and anyone who still enjoys customizing their Tumblr blog with classic HTML/CSS themes.
